# Studio — story backlog

`/studio` turns one long, rambly recording into a short video **re-voiced in the
user's own cloned voice**. The AI shortens the transcript and groups it into
scenes (chapters) with timestamps; the producer then builds each scene one at a
time. Each story is written to be picked up **with fresh context**: read
`00-architecture-and-state.md`, then the one story.

## 📍 Where we are now

**Prototype shipped + stories 01 / 01b / 02 done.** Prep is now a **manual,
step-by-step flow** under a top-level **stepper** (Import → Prep → Build →
Export) so it's clear where you are and what's next. Each real prep step has its
own button; the still-mocked downstream (shorten/segment/clone) is grouped behind
one "Finish prep" action. Story 01b added an **extract→upload-audio** step (the
WAV gets its own bucket upload so Replicate can transcribe it). Story 02 wired
**real transcription**: `/api/transcribe` mints a presigned audio URL and runs
Replicate **WhisperX** (`align_output:true` for word timestamps). ⚠️ Needs the
**Replicate API token** set in BFFless Settings → AI before it returns live.
Story 02b added the **transcript editor** (a GitHub-diff-style time grid under
the video) and **MSW dev mocks** (`MOCK_STUDIO`) so iterating never hits the
bucket or the paid model — `/api/transcribe` returns a real captured fixture.
**Story 03 shipped the AI master director**: `/api/scenes` (live, rule
`138f27fb`) signs each contact sheet and hands it + the timestamped transcript +
the creator's free-text direction to **`google/gemini-3.1-pro`**, which returns a
one-line **synopsis** plus **scenes** (tightened script, original-video span,
parseable `cuts`). The prep page got a **Director panel** (direction input + send
action), Build shows the synopsis + per-scene cuts, and the shortened script now
fills the 02b diff's right pane. **Story 04 shipped the voice step**: a
**VoiceStudio** resource at the bottom of prep where you either **clone your own
voice** (mic recorder + live level meter → `/api/voice/clone`), **reuse a saved
`voice_id`**, or **pick a MiniMax preset**, then **Generate a sample** to hear it
(live `/api/voice/say`, `speech-2.8-turbo`). The **$3 clone is now ENABLED**
(`minimax/voice-cloning`; recording re-encoded to WAV first; minted ids auto-saved
for free reuse) — built disabled-first behind a preset stub, flipped on after
verification. **Story 03c shipped the per-scene refiner + diff-viewer rework**: a
second, zoomed-in pass — `/api/refine-scene` (rule `afacb572`, Gemini 3.1 Pro fed
**dense per-scene** contact sheets) returns anchored narration **segments** +
refined **cuts**, written non-destructively to `scene.refined` (the director's
first pass is never overwritten; revert = clear it). The Build diff viewer is now
the edit surface: scene **tabs** + a `SceneMeta` panel beside the video, the
time-grid diff full-width below with **cuts as red cells**, equal-height panes,
and **per-segment inline voicing** — **record it yourself** (mic → WAV → bucket)
or **AI** (`/api/voice/narrate`, persisted mp3) — plus a **green** span showing
each clip's real length with the words fit to it. **Story 03e shipped the sprite
filmstrip gutter**: a fixed ~150px column down the left of the diff viewer showing
the contact-sheet frame nearest each row's time — reusing the already-captured
sheets as CSS sprites (`src/lib/filmstrip.ts`, `cellWidth/cellHeight/gap` now
persisted on `ContactSheet`), row-aligned to the grid (incl. segment spacers) so
it scrolls in lockstep. **The diff grid now draws out to the full clip
`duration`** (not just the last transcript word/cut), so trailing footage where the
talk ends before the clip does (e.g. speech stops ~0:50 on a 0:53 clip) renders as
**editable** rows the producer can hand-cut — it was previously invisible. **Story
05 shipped the ffmpeg assemble MVP**: the export step is now a single **walk of the
original timeline** — pure, unit-tested `src/lib/export/assemble.ts` (`buildSlices`
→ `planAssembly` → `buildFfmpegCommand`) tags every slice **cut** (drop) /
**segment** (keep + that clip's audio) / **dead** (keep + silence), **cut wins on
overlap**, and emits the `filter_complex` that trims+concats the kept footage
against the resampled narration clips + generated silence (one common 48 kHz mono
format; no loudnorm/crossfades yet). `src/lib/export/ffmpeg.ts` lazy-loads the
**single-threaded** ESM wasm core on first assemble (bundled locally from the
`@ffmpeg/core` npm package via Vite `?url` — no CDN; the 32 MB wasm is a hashed
asset fetched only on first assemble — no COOP/COEP needed), and `AssembleBar` drives it
from the Build view's **Export** step once every scene is built: progress bar,
errors surfaced, inline `<video>` preview + **Download MP4**. Trailing dead space
is **honored** (kept silent) so export = what the grid shows. The cut also **saves
like every other resource**: **Save to my library** uploads the MP4 via a new
presigned `export` flow (rules `2ec4f942`/`7459fb60`/`bea10a3d`) and persists only
the serve URL (`finalCutUrl`), so a refresh brings the saved cut back to
play/download — re-assemble + save overwrites it. Scenes carry a manual **Mark
built / re-open** toggle (tab ✓ + readiness line; never auto-set). **Story 05
optimizations are slated next but NOT done**: audio polish (per-segment `loudnorm`
+ short `acrossfade`), a stream-copy/no-re-encode speed path, and — **parked** —
multithreaded ffmpeg.wasm (`core-mt` is incompatible with `@ffmpeg/ffmpeg@0.12.15`'s
module worker + classic pthread workers; reverted to single-threaded). See story 05's
"Optimizations — slated next". **Stories 10a–10d shipped speaker diarization + per-person voices** (branch
`studio/diarization-cast-voices`): WhisperX now runs with `diarization:true` and
carries a per-word `speaker` label through the transcript; a new project **cast**
(`Person[]`) lets the producer name people and assign each one a voice; the
director receives a speaker-labelled transcript; and at Build each narration
segment defaults to its dominant speaker's voice with a per-segment override
`<select>`. **Next up overall: manual cut editing (03d phase) —
let the user add/remove cuts directly in the diff viewer** — then the wps knob.
(Per-scene scope shipped: the Build diff is now windowed to the selected scene tab
via `windowLines`, instead of rendering the whole talk.)

**The `studio/projects` initiative (stories 11a–11d) is COMPLETE.** All four
stories have shipped: 11a introduced projects as first-class entities
(local-first, keyed Redux collection, list/create/open/rename/delete UI, metadata
middleware, `savedVoices` hoisted to a shared library, clean-slate persist key
bump); 11b added URL-driven routing (`/studio/project/:id/:phase`,
`StudioProjectGuard`, phase clamp/resume via `resolvePhase`/`maxPhaseFor`, keyed
workspace remount, `revisitPrep`/`inExport` removed); 11c nested every upload under
`uploads/projects/<id>/<type>/…` via dynamic `subDir` interpolation (enabled by
`bffless/ce#324`) across all 6 prepare + 6 register rules + the narrate step,
added a new `GET /api/uploads/projects/*` serve rule (id `30355b6d`), and wired
project-delete to wipe the entire bucket prefix via `POST /api/projects/delete`
(`file_delete`, rule `67359cca`, best-effort client call + immediate local remove).
**11d (server-side project sync) shipped the durable home:** a `studio_projects`
data-table schema (`d183deed-…`) + CRUD rules (create `25fc934e`, list `d48bca6d`,
get `9f8c5a94`, save `1b510d2d`, delete extended on `67359cca` to also `data_delete`
the record), records addressed by a `projectId` field filter with timestamps stored
as `createdMs`/`updatedMs`; a pure `projectSync.ts` (last-write-wins reconcile,
local-only projects pushed up — no clean-slate); slice
`hydrateProject`/`evictWorking`/`evictOthers`/`reconcileServerIndex`; RTK CRUD +
MSW mocks; `useProjectAutosave` (debounced save · flush-on-exit · evict-others,
StrictMode-safe); list-from-server, create-on-server, and hydrate-or-redirect on
open. **Net: projects are now first-class, URL-addressable, per-project
bucket-stored, AND server-synced — they survive a cleared browser and follow the
user across devices.** Story **07** will layer auth / per-user scoping across the
studio routes (the destructive project + upload routes are flagged for
`auth_required` there).

Legend: ✅ done · ▶ next up · 🔨 in progress · 📝 spec ready · ⏳ queued. `*` = code done, needs
the Replicate API token in BFFless Settings → AI to run. `†` = shipped; open
non-blocking follow-ups (speed/smart-cut spike, encode-quality toggle). Stories 10a–10d shipped
together on one branch `studio/diarization-cast-voices` (one-branch-per-refactor convention).
Finish a story → set it ✅, move the file to `stories/done/`, promote the next to ▶.

## How to work it

1. Read `00-architecture-and-state.md`.
2. Each new `/api/*` gets an **MSW mock** in `src/mocks/handlers.ts` first;
   build/adjust the UI, then swap the stage's mock in
   `src/components/Studio/useScenePipeline.ts` for the real call.
3. One stage per PR — keep stories small and context cheap.

## Story 05 model (resolved — see `05-wire-ffmpeg-assemble.md`)

Assemble is a **walk of the original timeline** with three states per slice:
**cut** (drop video), **segment** (keep video + play that clip's audio), **dead
space** (keep video, silence). **Cut wins on overlap.** Video and audio build from
the same walk, so they're the same length and in sync — **no footage-fit step**
(the edit UI already prevents cutting more time than the audio occupies). The old
"speed up / trim to fit the narration" question is therefore moot.

**MVP first** (cut/keep/silence + plain concat + resample-to-common-format), then
sprinkle on loudness-normalization + crossfades. **First bug to fix:** trailing
dead space after the last segment leaks silent video onto the end of the export.
