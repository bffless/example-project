 * Owns the URL→state contract for a single project (server-sync aware):
 * - working present locally → syncs Redux `activeProjectId` from the URL (so the
 *   slice's active() write-routing keeps working) and waits for it before mounting,
 * - working missing → hydrate-or-redirect: fetch the project from the server, show
 *   a load state, hydrate on success, and fall back to the list only when the
 *   project is truly unknown (not in the local index AND the server has no record),
 * - resolves/clamps :phase against the project's readiness ladder.
 * The workspace is keyed by projectId so switching projects remounts it (resets
 * transient in-memory clip state).
