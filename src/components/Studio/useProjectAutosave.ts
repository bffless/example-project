/**
 * Server-side autosave for the ACTIVE project's working state (story 11d, task 6).
 *
 * Mounted by the keyed-by-projectId Studio workspace (11b): each project gets its
 * own workspace instance, so LEAVING a project unmounts the workspace and fires
 * this hook's cleanup. Responsibilities:
 *  - debounce-save the working state to the server whenever it changes,
 *  - flush a final save on `beforeunload` and on unmount,
 *  - on MOUNT, evict every OTHER project's heavy working state from local memory
 *    (keep only the active one; the server is the source of truth and re-opening
 *    hydrates from it). Eviction on ENTER is idempotent, so it survives React 19
 *    StrictMode's synthetic mount→unmount→mount without ever dropping the active
 *    project's just-hydrated working state (the old self-evict-on-unmount did).
 *  - expose a `{ status, savedAt }` for a small "Saving…/Saved" UI indicator.
 *
 * Pitfalls handled here:
 *  - **No setState after unmount.** The unmount cleanup runs a final save but
 *    must not touch React state (the component is gone). A `mounted` ref gates
 *    every `setStatus`/`setSavedAt`; the cleanup sets `mounted.current = false`
 *    before saving so the save's `.then/.catch` stay silent. In-session
 *    (debounced) saves DO update status — the component is still mounted.
 *  - **Stale closures.** The freshest working/meta is read from a `latest` ref so
 *    the debounce/beforeunload/unmount saves always persist current state without
 *    re-subscribing the effects on every keystroke.
 *  - **No save on hydrate.** A `first` ref skips the initial render so opening a
 *    project doesn't immediately re-save it.
